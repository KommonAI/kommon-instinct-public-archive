# Self-hosting Open Instinct

This guide runs one Open Instinct agent on a machine you control. That can be your laptop, a home server, or a VPS. Nothing here needs Maritime hosting. The agent is one Node process, one data directory, and (optionally) one Inkbox identity so you can text it on iMessage.

Open Instinct is unrelated to OpenInstinct, a separate project published by Merit Systems.

Analogy: the agent is a person who works from home. Inkbox is their phone line. The data directory is their filing cabinet. This guide sets up the home office.

## What you need

| Item | Why | Required |
|---|---|---|
| Node 22.19 or newer and pnpm | runs the agent and the CLI | yes |
| A model key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `OPENAI_API_KEY` with `OPENAI_BASE_URL`) | the model behind the agent | yes |
| An Inkbox admin key (`INKBOX_ADMIN_API_KEY`) from the Inkbox console | gives the agent an iMessage line, email and A2A endpoint | for iMessage |
| A Maritime key (`MARITIME_API_KEY`) with the `computers` scope | a hosted Linux desktop the agent can drive | for computer use |
| Docker | only for the Compose path | no |

The machine needs outbound HTTPS only. No inbound ports, no domain, no TLS certificate. The Inkbox tunnel handles the public side.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mariagorskikh/open-instinct && cd open-instinct
pnpm install && pnpm -r build
```

Run the CLI from inside the repo:

```bash
pnpm --filter @open-instinct/cli exec instinct --help
```

Or link it so `instinct` is on your PATH:

```bash
cd packages/cli && pnpm link --global && cd ../..
instinct --help
```

The rest of this guide writes `instinct ...` and assumes one of those two.

## Step 1: `instinct init`

`init` writes `config.json` into the data directory. With `INKBOX_ADMIN_API_KEY` in the environment it also creates the agent's Inkbox identity.

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export INKBOX_ADMIN_API_KEY=ApiKey_...

instinct init --name "Maria" --phone +14155550100 --email maria@example.com \
  --handle maria-instinct --timezone America/New_York
```

What each flag does:

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--name` | your name. Required |
| `--phone`, `--email` | how the agent knows a message is from you, the owner |
| `--handle` | the agent's Inkbox handle. People will text `connect @maria-instinct` |
| `--timezone` | used in prompts and schedules |
| `--model` | `provider/model-id`. Default `anthropic/claude-fable-5-1` |
| `--skip-inkbox` | write config only, even when an admin key is set |

With the admin key, `init` does five things on Inkbox:

1. Creates the identity `@maria-instinct` with iMessage enabled.
2. Mints an identity-scoped API key. This is the key the agent process runs with.
3. Creates the webhook signing key.
4. Saves all of it to `<dataDir>/secrets/inkbox.json` with mode 0600.
5. Prints the connect instructions.

If the handle is taken, Inkbox gives you `maria-instinct-2` and `init` saves that name. If your Inkbox plan is full, `init` stops with the plan limit error and the billing URL. See [INKBOX.md](INKBOX.md#plan-limits).

Running `init` again updates the existing config. It does not wipe anything.

## Step 2: `instinct dev --tunnel`

`dev` runs the agent server in the current process. No Docker. No Maritime.

```bash
instinct dev --tunnel
```

Expected output:

```
Open Instinct is running on http://127.0.0.1:8080  (data: /Users/maria/.instinct)
  tunnel: https://maria-instinct.inkboxwire.com
  webhook: subscription whs_8f2 (new)
```

`dev` loads `secrets/inkbox.json` into the environment, so you do not export `INKBOX_API_KEY` yourself. Ctrl-C closes the tunnel, the server and the agent cleanly.

Flags:

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--port 8080` | local port. Default 8080 |
| `--host 127.0.0.1` | bind address. `dev` defaults to `0.0.0.0`, so pass this on a shared machine or set a chat token |
| `--tunnel` | open the Inkbox tunnel and subscribe the webhook |
| `--quiet` | less log output |
| `--data-dir <dir>` | use another data directory |

Without `--tunnel` the agent still runs. You can talk to it from a second terminal:

```bash
instinct chat "remember that I like window seats"
instinct status
```

But iMessage cannot reach it. Inkbox needs a public URL to post events to. That is what the tunnel provides.

## How the tunnel gives you a public webhook URL

Inkbox posts every inbound message to your agent as an HTTP webhook. A laptop behind a home router has no public address. Instead of opening a port, the agent opens an outbound connection to Inkbox, and Inkbox forwards traffic back down it.

Analogy: you cannot receive mail at a desk in a coworking space. So you rent a mailbox at the front desk, and the receptionist walks letters to you.

Step by step:

1. `instinct dev --tunnel` sets `INSTINCT_TUNNEL=1`.
2. The server starts a second listener on loopback that answers only `GET /health` and `POST /webhooks/inkbox`. Everything else on that listener is 404.
3. The CLI opens an Inkbox tunnel with the identity key and the handle. Every identity owns the host `https://<handle>.inkboxwire.com`. The tunnel is outbound HTTP/2, so it works from inside any network that allows HTTPS out.
4. With `INKBOX_ADMIN_API_KEY` set, the CLI subscribes the identity's webhooks to `https://<handle>.inkboxwire.com/webhooks/inkbox`. An existing subscription for the same URL is reused. The signing key is stored in `<dataDir>/secrets/webhook.json`.
5. Without the admin key, the CLI prints the URL and you create the subscription yourself in the Inkbox console or with the API. See [INKBOX.md](INKBOX.md#webhooks-and-signing-keys).

Two safety points:

- The tunnel never exposes `/chat`, `/status` or `/schedules`. Those are the owner's surface and stay on your local port only.
- Every webhook is checked against the signing key before the agent reads it. A bad or missing signature gets 401. A missing key gets 503.

## Step 3: connect your iPhone

```bash
instinct connect
```

Output:

```
Connect your iMessage
  1. Text connect @maria-instinct to +1 415 555 0199
  2. A new thread from your Instinct appears. Say hi.
  Tap-to-text link: sms:...
  QR code written to /Users/maria/.instinct/connect-qr.png
```

Inkbox runs a shared iMessage router number. You text `connect @handle` to it once. From then on you have a normal iMessage thread with your agent. The first message must come from you. The agent on the shared line cannot text a stranger first. Details are in [INKBOX.md](INKBOX.md#the-shared-router-and-connect-handle).

## Docker Compose

The Compose path runs the same server in a container. It is a good fit for a VPS.

```bash
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env
# fill in the model key, owner fields and Inkbox values
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

The agent answers on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. The port is published on loopback only.

How it maps:

| Compose setting | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8080` | the port inside the container |
| `INSTINCT_DATA_DIR` | `/data` | state, on the `agent-data` volume |
| `INSTINCT_SKILLS_DIR` | `/app/skills` | the SKILL.md playbooks copied into the image |
| `env_file` | `deploy/.env` | every other variable |
| `restart` | `unless-stopped` | comes back after a reboot |

Notes for this path:

- The container runs as the unprivileged `instinct` user. The entrypoint only uses root to make `/data` writable, then drops privileges.
- Without Inkbox keys the agent still runs. Replies go to the container log (`docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml logs -f agent`).
- To receive iMessage in a container, set `INSTINCT_TUNNEL=1` in `deploy/.env` along with the `INKBOX_*` values. The server opens the tunnel itself and, with `INKBOX_ADMIN_API_KEY`, subscribes the webhook.
- Set `INSTINCT_CHAT_TOKEN` in `deploy/.env` if anything beyond this machine should reach `/chat`. See [Keeping the owner surface private](#keeping-the-owner-surface-private).
- The `gateway` service in the same file is for the multi-user shape. It needs `--profile gateway` and is not part of a single-person self-host. See the [gateway README](../packages/gateway/README.md).

To run `instinct` commands against the container's data, point them at the same directory. The simplest way is to run the CLI on the host with `--data-dir` set to a bind mount, or to keep the CLI's `.instinct` for `init` and copy `secrets/inkbox.json` values into `deploy/.env`.

## Where state lives

Everything is in one directory. The CLI default is `./.instinct`. The server default is `/data` when that directory exists, else `./.instinct`. `INSTINCT_DATA_DIR` or `--data-dir` overrides both.

| Path | What it holds | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| `config.json` | owner (name, phones, emails, timezone), agent name and handle, model, feature flags | `init`, first boot |
| `secrets/inkbox.json` | identity key, identity id, signing key, handle. Mode 0600 | `init` |
| `secrets/webhook.json` | webhook subscription id, URL, signing key. Mode 0600 | `dev --tunnel`, server |
| `contacts.json` | people, their phones, emails, agent handles and tiers | `invite`, `trust set`, the agent |
| `policy.json` | tiers, grants, spend limits | `trust grant`, `trust revoke`, the agent |
| `schedules.json` | cron and one-shot jobs | `schedules`, the agent |
| `approvals.json` | pending owner approvals | the agent |
| `memory/MEMORY.md` | durable memory, plain Markdown | the agent |
| `memory/journal/` | one file per day | the agent |
| `sessions/` | Pi JSONL transcripts, one per conversation | the agent |
| `audit.jsonl` | append-only log of every side effect | the agent |
| `workspace/` | files the agent makes for you | the agent |
| `inbox/` | files you sent to the agent | the agent |
| `maritime.json` | the deployed agent id, only after `instinct deploy` | `deploy` |
| `connect-qr.png` | the connect QR | `connect` |

Two rules worth knowing:

- `config.json` wins over the environment after the first boot. Env seeds it; it does not override it later. To change the owner or the model, run `init` again or edit the file.
- Memory is Markdown. You can open `memory/MEMORY.md` and read or fix it by hand.

## Backups

Back up the whole data directory. It is small, mostly text, and contains everything the agent knows.

What matters most:

| File | If lost |
|---|---|
| `secrets/inkbox.json` | the agent cannot send or receive. Inkbox shows the identity key and signing key only once. You would mint new ones with the admin key |
| `secrets/webhook.json` | the server cannot verify webhooks until it mints a new signing key |
| `memory/`, `sessions/`, `audit.jsonl` | the agent forgets, and you lose the record of what it did |
| `contacts.json`, `policy.json` | the trusted network and grants are gone |

Local run:

```bash
tar czf instinct-backup-$(date +%F).tgz -C "$(dirname "$INSTINCT_DATA_DIR")" "$(basename "$INSTINCT_DATA_DIR")"
```

Docker Compose keeps `/data` on a named volume. Compose names it after the project, which defaults to the directory name, so look it up first:

```bash
docker volume ls | grep agent-data
docker run --rm -v deploy_agent-data:/data -v "$PWD":/backup alpine \
  tar czf /backup/instinct-backup-$(date +%F).tgz -C /data .
```

Store the archive somewhere encrypted. It contains API keys.

Restore is the reverse: stop the agent, unpack into the data directory (or the volume), start it again. Keep file modes: `secrets/` should be 0700 and the files inside 0600.

## Updating

Local run:

```bash
git pull
pnpm install && pnpm -r build
# restart instinct dev
```

Docker Compose:

```bash
git pull
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up --build -d
```

State lives outside the code, so an update never touches the data directory. Run `instinct status` after a restart to confirm the agent name, model and computer kind are what you expect.

## The computer: none, or hosted

Open Instinct can drive a Linux desktop: open a browser, click, type, read a page. On Maritime the desktop runs inside the agent's own VM. When you self-host there is no desktop next to the agent. You have two choices.

| Mode | Set | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| No computer | `INSTINCT_COMPUTER=none` | the agent has no `computer` tools. It still texts, emails, reads Gmail and Calendar through Composio, runs schedules, and talks to other Instincts |
| Hosted computer | `MARITIME_API_KEY=mk_...` and `INSTINCT_COMPUTER=auto` (the default) or `maritime` | the agent uses Maritime Computers over MCP. Maritime keeps one persistent desktop for you behind `https://mcp.maritime.sh` |

How `auto` decides: it probes for an in-VM desktop first. On your own machine there is none. If `MARITIME_API_KEY` is set, it uses the hosted computer. Otherwise it runs with no computer. Nothing fails; the tool set is just smaller.

Hosted computer details:

- The key needs the `computers` scope. Mint it in the Maritime dashboard.
- `MARITIME_COMPUTERS_MCP_URL` changes the endpoint. Default `https://mcp.maritime.sh`.
- The first call creates the desktop and can take up to 60 seconds. A sleeping desktop wakes in a few seconds.
- A `402 no_plan` means the Maritime account has no Computers plan. The key being valid does not prove the plan exists. Test with one real action.
- Logins, 2FA and payments are yours. The agent calls `request_takeover` and texts you a viewer link. You do the step in a browser and click Done. The agent sees nothing while you are in control.

More in the [computer package README](../packages/computer/README.md).

## Keeping the owner surface private

`POST /chat`, `GET /status` and `GET /schedules` run with the full owner tool set. Anyone who can reach them is you, as far as the agent is concerned. Two guards exist.

1. Bind address. A bare `node packages/server/dist/main.js` with no `PORT` listens on `127.0.0.1` only. `instinct dev` is different: it sets `PORT` and binds `0.0.0.0` unless you pass `--host 127.0.0.1`. Compose publishes `127.0.0.1:8080` on the host, so the container port is not reachable from outside.
2. Token. Set `INSTINCT_CHAT_TOKEN` to a random string. Every call must then send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (or `X-Instinct-Token: <token>`) or it gets 401.

```bash
export INSTINCT_CHAT_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 24)
instinct dev --host 127.0.0.1 --tunnel
```

One caveat. The CLI does not send the token today. With a token set, `instinct chat` and `instinct status` get 401. Talk to the agent with curl instead:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTINCT_CHAT_TOKEN" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"message":"hi"}'
```

Or keep the token off, bind loopback with `--host 127.0.0.1`, and use the CLI as normal. On a laptop that is enough. On a VPS, set the token.

The tunnel does not change any of this. It carries signed webhooks only and never reaches `/chat`.

## Environment variables

Every variable below is read by the server or the CLI. `deploy/.env.example` lists them with comments. `config.json` wins over most of them after the first boot.

| Variable | Read by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `INSTINCT_DATA_DIR` | server, CLI | the data directory |
| `INSTINCT_MODEL` | server | `provider/model`. Default `anthropic/claude-fable-5-1`. `openai-compatible/<id>` uses `OPENAI_BASE_URL` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | server, CLI | model access |
| `INSTINCT_OWNER_NAME`, `INSTINCT_OWNER_PHONE`, `INSTINCT_OWNER_EMAIL`, `INSTINCT_OWNER_TIMEZONE`, `INSTINCT_AGENT_NAME` | server | seed `config.json` on first boot. `init` flags do the same job |
| `INKBOX_API_KEY`, `INKBOX_AGENT_HANDLE`, `INKBOX_IDENTITY_ID`, `INKBOX_SIGNING_KEY` | server, CLI | the identity-scoped Inkbox credentials. `init` saves them in `secrets/inkbox.json`; `dev` loads them |
| `INKBOX_ADMIN_API_KEY` | CLI, server | org-wide key. Provisions the identity, subscribes webhooks, creates invitations |
| `INKBOX_BASE_URL` | CLI, server | only for a self-hosted Inkbox |
| `INSTINCT_TUNNEL` | server, CLI | `1` opens the Inkbox tunnel. `dev --tunnel` sets it |
| `INSTINCT_CHAT_TOKEN` | server, CLI | bearer token for the owner surface |
| `INSTINCT_BIND` | server | bind address override |
| `INSTINCT_PUBLIC_URL` | server | public URL of the agent, used to build the Stripe Link callback |
| `INSTINCT_COMPUTER` | server | `auto`, `desktopd`, `maritime`, `none` |
| `MARITIME_API_KEY` | server, CLI | hosted computer (scope `computers`), and `instinct deploy` |
| `MARITIME_COMPUTERS_MCP_URL` | server | hosted computer endpoint. Default `https://mcp.maritime.sh` |
| `COMPOSIO_API_KEY`, `COMPOSIO_TOOLKITS` | server, CLI | Gmail, Calendar and other apps. The key alone turns apps on |
| `LINK_CLIENT_ID`, `LINK_CLIENT_SECRET`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `LINK_REDIRECT_URI` | server, CLI | Stripe Link agent wallet. All of the first three are needed for payment tools |
| `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` | server, CLI | better web search. DuckDuckGo otherwise |
| `INSTINCT_SKILLS_DIR` | server | SKILL.md folder. Default `<repo>/skills` |
| `INSTINCT_REPLY_BUDGET_MS` | server | how long `/chat` waits before acknowledging and finishing in the background. Default 20000 |
| `PORT` | server | listen port. Default 8080 |
| `NO_COLOR`, `INSTINCT_DEBUG` | CLI | plain output; stack traces |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `no tunnel: iMessage webhooks need --tunnel or the gateway` | `dev` started without the flag | run `instinct dev --tunnel` |
| `INKBOX_API_KEY and INKBOX_AGENT_HANDLE are required` | no `secrets/inkbox.json` | run `instinct init` with `INKBOX_ADMIN_API_KEY` set |
| `webhook: subscribe Inkbox events to https://...` printed in grey | no admin key, so no auto-subscribe | set `INKBOX_ADMIN_API_KEY`, or subscribe by hand to the printed URL |
| texts from your phone get no answer | your number is not the owner's | check `--phone` in `init` matches the iPhone you text from, in E.164 form |
| webhook returns 401 | signing key mismatch | delete `secrets/webhook.json` and restart with the admin key, or set `INKBOX_SIGNING_KEY` to the current key |
| webhook returns 503 | no signing key configured at all | same as above |
| `Inkbox plan limit` on `init` | the org is at its identity cap | upgrade, or delete an unused identity |
| `402 no_plan` on a computer action | Maritime account has no Computers plan | add the plan, or set `INSTINCT_COMPUTER=none` |
| `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` set but no app tools | `config.json` has `apps.enabled: false` | run `instinct init --name <you> --apps` |
